# farmOS 2-x Image

The files in this directory are copied from the farmOS project at:
* https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS/tree/2.x/docker

They are duplicated here so that we can build multi architecture images for the FarmData2 project.

In addition, we build and store our own images so that we can upgrade / update in a fully controlled way.
